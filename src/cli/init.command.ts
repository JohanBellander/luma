## Purpose

This project uses **LUMA (Layout & UX Mockup Analyzer)** to guide UI design **before coding**.
Your job is to:
1. Design UI **structurally** using Scaffold JSON.
2. Validate and refine the scaffold using LUMA.
3. Only generate implementation code **after** the scaffold passes scoring.

Do **not** generate JSX/HTML/CSS until LUMA says the scaffold is ready.

---

## Design & Development Workflow (Follow Exactly)

### 0. Preflight: Understand the Contract

Before generating any scaffold, read the canonical contract:
\`\`\`
luma explain --topic scaffold-contract --json
\`\`\`

This defines the exact rules for valid scaffolds. You can also use the golden template as reference:
\`\`\`
luma explain --topic golden-template --json
\`\`\`

For new scaffolds, you can generate from patterns instead of writing JSON manually:
\`\`\`
luma scaffold new --pattern todo-list --out ui/screens/my-screen.mock.json
luma scaffold new --pattern empty-screen --out ui/screens/base.mock.json
\`\`\`

---

### 1. Start with a UI Goal

Identify the screen you need to design. Examples:
- Data table with filtering
- Multi-step form
- Dashboard with widgets
- Login/authentication screen
- Settings panel

Do **not** write code yet ‚Äî only define the UI structure as a **scaffold**.

---

### 2. Produce a Scaffold

**Option A: Generate from pattern**
\`\`\`
luma scaffold new --pattern <pattern-name> --out ui/screens/<screen>.mock.json
\`\`\`

**Option B: Write JSON manually**
Create a file in \`ui/screens/<screen>.mock.json\` using **Component Scaffold JSON** format (Stacks, Forms, Fields, Tables, Buttons, etc.).

Store scaffolds in a dedicated folder like:
- \`ui/screens/\`
- \`design/scaffolds/\`
- \`mockups/\`

---

### 3. Validate with LUMA

Run the full LUMA pipeline:

\`\`\`
luma ingest ui/screens/<screen>.mock.json
luma layout ui/screens/<screen>.mock.json --viewports 320x640,768x1024
luma keyboard ui/screens/<screen>.mock.json
luma flow ui/screens/<screen>.mock.json --patterns form,table
luma score .ui/runs/<run-id>
\`\`\`

If **any** MUST rule fails or **overall score < 85**:

‚Üí **Revise the scaffold, not the code.**

---

### 4. Iterate Until Passing

Repeat the scaffold ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí adjust cycle until:

- No blocking layout issues (overflow, spacing violations)
- Keyboard flow is linear and all interactive elements reachable
- Patterns pass their MUST rules (especially Form.Basic & Table.Simple)
- Overall score ‚â• **85**

This is the **design approval checkpoint**.

---

### 5. Implementation Phase - CRITICAL COMPLIANCE RULES

**üö® SCAFFOLD FIDELITY REQUIREMENTS:**

Once the scaffold is approved (score ‚â• 85), follow these **mandatory** rules:

**1. Component Mapping Rule**
- Every HTML/JSX element MUST map 1:1 to a scaffold component
- If scaffold has 5 components ‚Üí implementation has exactly 5 components
- **NO additional UI elements** beyond the scaffold definition

**2. ID Preservation Rule**
- All scaffold component IDs MUST be preserved exactly in implementation
- Example: \`"id": "contact-form"\` ‚Üí \`<form id="contact-form">\`
- No renaming, no omitting IDs

**3. Structure Immutability Rule**
- The component hierarchy cannot change during implementation
- If scaffold shows Stack > Text > Button > Form ‚Üí code follows exactly
- No reordering, no nesting changes

**4. Feature Freeze Rule**
- NO additional functionality beyond scaffold definition
- If scaffold doesn't include a "delete" button ‚Üí don't implement delete
- If scaffold has 3 form fields ‚Üí implement exactly 3 fields

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN DURING IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Adding components not in scaffold (e.g., extra buttons, fields, tables)
- Adding form fields not defined in scaffold
- Changing component hierarchy or order
- Implementing features that didn't pass LUMA validation
- Using non-scaffold approaches when validation fails

**‚úÖ ALLOWED DURING IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Styling (colors, fonts, spacing) per design system
- Accessibility attributes (aria-labels, roles, etc.)
- Event handlers for interactions defined by scaffold components
- CSS classes for styling (but not structural changes)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**1. "Helpful Additions"**
- ‚ùå "Users probably want a cancel button, let me add that"
- ‚úÖ "Scaffold doesn't include cancel, so I won't implement it"

**2. "Technical Workarounds"**
- ‚ùå "Table validation failed, I'll use an HTML table instead"
- ‚úÖ "Table failed validation, I need to fix the scaffold first"

**3. "Obvious Missing Pieces"**
- ‚ùå "Obviously need a contact list, even though scaffold doesn't show it"
- ‚úÖ "If it's not in the approved scaffold, it doesn't get implemented"

**4. "Scope Creep During Implementation"**
- ‚ùå Adding extra fields, buttons, or sections while coding
- ‚úÖ Stop implementation, update scaffold, re-validate, then code

**If You Want to Add Features:**
1. STOP implementation
2. Update the scaffold JSON with new components
3. Re-run full LUMA pipeline: \`ingest ‚Üí layout ‚Üí keyboard ‚Üí flow ‚Üí score\`
4. Get new approval (score ‚â• 85)
5. THEN implement the expanded scaffold

**Never implement features that haven't passed LUMA validation.**

## Key Rules

| Do | Do Not |
|---|---|
| Design UI in scaffold form first | Jump straight to HTML/JSX |
| Run \`luma score\` before coding | Ignore failing pattern rules |
| Use \`luma scaffold new\` for quick starts | Write invalid JSON manually |
| **Implement ONLY what's in approved scaffold** | **Add features during implementation** |
| **Map scaffold components 1:1 to HTML** | **Add extra form fields, buttons, or sections** |
| **Preserve all scaffold component IDs** | **Rename or omit scaffold-defined IDs** |
| Iterate until layout/flow are correct | Hardcode layout fixes in CSS later |
| Keep scaffolds committed in VCS | Let scaffolds drift from implementation |
