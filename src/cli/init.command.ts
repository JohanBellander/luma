## Purpose

This project uses **LUMA (Layout & UX Mockup Analyzer)** to guide UI design **before coding**.
Your job is to:
1. Design UI **structurally** using Scaffold JSON.
2. Validate and refine the scaffold using LUMA.
3. Only generate implementation code **after** the scaffold passes scoring.

Do **not** generate JSX/HTML/CSS until LUMA says the scaffold is ready.

---

## Design & Development Workflow (Follow Exactly)

### 0. Preflight: Understand the Contract

Before generating any scaffold, read the canonical contract:
\`\`\`
luma explain --topic scaffold-contract --json
\`\`\`

This defines the exact rules for valid scaffolds. You can also use the golden template as reference:
\`\`\`
luma explain --topic golden-template --json
\`\`\`

For new scaffolds, you can generate from patterns instead of writing JSON manually:
\`\`\`
luma scaffold new --pattern todo-list --out ui/screens/my-screen.mock.json
luma scaffold new --pattern empty-screen --out ui/screens/base.mock.json
\`\`\`

---

### 1. Start with a UI Goal

Identify the screen you need to design. Examples:
- Data table with filtering
- Multi-step form
- Dashboard with widgets
- Login/authentication screen
- Settings panel

Do **not** write code yet ‚Äî only define the UI structure as a **scaffold**.

---

### 2. Produce a Scaffold

**Option A: Generate from pattern**
\`\`\`
luma scaffold new --pattern <pattern-name> --out ui/screens/<screen>.mock.json
\`\`\`

**Option B: Write JSON manually**
Create a file in \`ui/screens/<screen>.mock.json\` using **Component Scaffold JSON** format (Stacks, Forms, Fields, Tables, Buttons, etc.).

Store scaffolds in a dedicated folder like:
- \`ui/screens/\`
- \`design/scaffolds/\`
- \`mockups/\`

**FUNCTIONAL COMPLETENESS CHECK:**

Before finalizing your scaffold, verify EVERY interactive element has a complete workflow:

- [ ] Every Button has a defined action target (Form, another screen, etc.)
- [ ] Every Form has defined fields and submission behavior
- [ ] No "dead-end" interactions (buttons that lead nowhere)

**Common Incomplete Patterns to Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Button without target: "Add Contact" button with no form definition
- ‚ùå Form without submission: Contact form with no save workflow
- ‚úÖ Complete workflow: Button ‚Üí opens Form ‚Üí Form has fields and actions

**If ANY interactive element lacks a target or workflow ‚Üí Add missing components to scaffold**

---

### 3. Validate with LUMA

Run the full LUMA pipeline:

\`\`\`
luma ingest ui/screens/<screen>.mock.json
luma layout ui/screens/<screen>.mock.json --viewports 320x640,768x1024
luma keyboard ui/screens/<screen>.mock.json
luma flow ui/screens/<screen>.mock.json --patterns form,table
luma score .ui/runs/<run-id>
\`\`\`

If **any** MUST rule fails or **overall score < 85**:

‚Üí **Revise the scaffold, not the code.**

---

### 4. Iterate Until Passing

Repeat the scaffold ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí adjust cycle until:

- No blocking layout issues (overflow, spacing violations)
- Keyboard flow is linear and all interactive elements reachable
- Patterns pass their MUST rules (especially Form.Basic & Table.Simple)
- Overall score ‚â• **85**

This is the **design approval checkpoint**.

---

### 4.5. PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKPOINT

üõë **MANDATORY REVIEW - Complete BEFORE writing ANY code:**

**Functional Completeness Audit:**
1. List EVERY component in your approved scaffold
2. For each interactive component (Button, Field), verify its action target exists
3. Check for workflow gaps or "dead-end" interactions

**Example Audit:**
\`\`\`
Component Inventory:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ title (Text)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ add-contact-btn (Button) ‚Üí Target: ??? ‚ùå MISSING FORM
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contact-table (Table)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Need to add: contact-form]
\`\`\`

**Critical Questions:**
- Can I implement every button's action using ONLY scaffold components?
- Does every interactive element have a complete workflow?
- Are there any "obvious but missing" features?

**üö® CHECKPOINT FAILURE = Scaffold is incomplete**

If you answer "no" to any question:
1. üõë DO NOT start implementation
2. üìù Update scaffold with missing components
3. üîÑ Re-run LUMA validation (ingest ‚Üí layout ‚Üí keyboard ‚Üí flow ‚Üí score)
4. ‚úÖ Only proceed when score ‚â• 85 AND all workflows complete

**Red Flag Thoughts During This Review:**
- "I'll need to add a modal to make this button work" ‚Üí ‚ùå STOP, update scaffold
- "Users will expect a form here" ‚Üí ‚ùå STOP, update scaffold
- "This obviously needs..." ‚Üí ‚ùå STOP, update scaffold

---

### 5. Implementation Phase - CRITICAL COMPLIANCE RULES

**üö® SCAFFOLD FIDELITY REQUIREMENTS:**

Once the scaffold is approved (score ‚â• 85), follow these **mandatory** rules:

**1. Component Mapping Rule**
- Every HTML/JSX element MUST map 1:1 to a scaffold component
- If scaffold has 5 components ‚Üí implementation has exactly 5 components
- **NO additional UI elements** beyond the scaffold definition

**2. ID Preservation Rule**
- All scaffold component IDs MUST be preserved exactly in implementation
- Example: \`"id": "contact-form"\` ‚Üí \`<form id="contact-form">\`
- No renaming, no omitting IDs

**3. Structure Immutability Rule**
- The component hierarchy cannot change during implementation
- If scaffold shows Stack > Text > Button > Form ‚Üí code follows exactly
- No reordering, no nesting changes

**4. Feature Freeze Rule**
- NO additional functionality beyond scaffold definition
- If scaffold doesn't include a "delete" button ‚Üí don't implement delete
- If scaffold has 3 form fields ‚Üí implement exactly 3 fields

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN DURING IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Adding components not in scaffold (e.g., extra buttons, fields, tables)
- Adding form fields not defined in scaffold
- Changing component hierarchy or order
- Implementing features that didn't pass LUMA validation
- Using non-scaffold approaches when validation fails

**‚úÖ ALLOWED DURING IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Styling (colors, fonts, spacing) per design system
- Accessibility attributes (aria-labels, roles, etc.)
- Event handlers for interactions defined by scaffold components
- CSS classes for styling (but not structural changes)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**1. "Helpful Additions"**
- ‚ùå "Users probably want a cancel button, let me add that"
- ‚úÖ "Scaffold doesn't include cancel, so I won't implement it"

**2. "Technical Workarounds"**
- ‚ùå "Table validation failed, I'll use an HTML table instead"
- ‚úÖ "Table failed validation, I need to fix the scaffold first"

**3. "Obvious Missing Pieces" - MAJOR VIOLATION**
- ‚ùå "Obviously need a contact form for the Add Contact button"
- ‚ùå "Users will expect a modal when clicking this button"
- ‚ùå "The button is useless without a form, so I'll add one"
- ‚úÖ "Button exists but form is missing ‚Üí scaffold is incomplete ‚Üí update scaffold first"

**4. "Scope Creep During Implementation"**
- ‚ùå Adding extra fields, buttons, or sections while coding
- ‚úÖ Stop implementation, update scaffold, re-validate, then code

**üö® RED FLAG PHRASES - Stop Immediately if You Think:**
- "Obviously need..."
- "Users will expect..."
- "This button should..."
- "To make this work, I'll add..."
- "For better UX, let me..."
- "I'll just quickly add..."

**When you catch yourself using these phrases ‚Üí You are about to violate scaffold fidelity**

**Correct Response When You Catch a Red Flag:**
1. STOP implementation immediately
2. Identify what's missing in the scaffold
3. Update scaffold JSON with needed components
4. Re-run LUMA validation pipeline
5. Resume implementation only after approval (score ‚â• 85)

**If You Want to Add Features:**
1. STOP implementation
2. Update the scaffold JSON with new components
3. Re-run full LUMA pipeline: \`ingest ‚Üí layout ‚Üí keyboard ‚Üí flow ‚Üí score\`
4. Get new approval (score ‚â• 85)
5. THEN implement the expanded scaffold

**Never implement features that haven't passed LUMA validation.**

## Key Rules

| Do | Do Not |
|---|---|
| Design UI in scaffold form first | Jump straight to HTML/JSX |
| Run \`luma score\` before coding | Ignore failing pattern rules |
| Use \`luma scaffold new\` for quick starts | Write invalid JSON manually |
| **Implement ONLY what's in approved scaffold** | **Add features during implementation** |
| **Map scaffold components 1:1 to HTML** | **Add extra form fields, buttons, or sections** |
| **Preserve all scaffold component IDs** | **Rename or omit scaffold-defined IDs** |
| Iterate until layout/flow are correct | Hardcode layout fixes in CSS later |
| Keep scaffolds committed in VCS | Let scaffolds drift from implementation |

## Real-World Example: The Modal Form Violation

**What Happened:**
An agent created a CRM scaffold with:
- Title text
- "Add Contact" button
- Contact table

During implementation, the agent added a contact form modal to make the button functional, even though no form was in the scaffold.

**Why This Was Wrong:**
- ‚ùå Violated Component Mapping Rule (3 components ‚Üí 4+ elements)
- ‚ùå Violated Feature Freeze Rule (modal not in scaffold)
- ‚ùå Added functionality that hadn't passed LUMA validation

**What Should Have Happened:**
1. **At Step 4.5 (Pre-Implementation Checkpoint)**: Agent should have noticed "Add Contact" button has no target form
2. **Correct Action**: STOP, update scaffold to include the contact form
3. **Re-validate**: Run LUMA pipeline on updated scaffold
4. **Then Implement**: Build the approved scaffold including the form

**Key Lesson:** Never add components during implementation to "make things work" - always ensure complete workflows are in the approved scaffold first.
